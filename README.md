dasein-cloud-rackspace
======================

This Dasein Cloud sub-module is a DEPRECATED sub-module for implementing the old CloudServers and CloudFiles
APIs for the Rackspace Cloud prior to the current OpenStack cloud. Both clouds are currently operating side-by-side,
so you may need both this project and the OpenStack one to support older Rackspace accounts.
